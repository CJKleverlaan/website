# Pre-Proposal round 2026 ‘Appropriate, Personalised, Effective & Efficient Care’ 

Do you have an innovative idea in dentistry and oral care that could use support, in collaboration with a private partner? Then it is time to submit your grant application now. The ORANGEHealth PPP program is issuing the call for the "Appropriate, Person-Centered, Effective & Efficient Care" round here. This program offers financial support for collaborations with private partners. In 2026, approximately 7-8 ORANGEHealth PPP projects will be awarded, each with a PPP contribution of €100,000-250,000. Applicant consortia must consist of at least two members of the ORANGEHealth program group (university and university of applied sciences) and a Dutch private party. Of course, multiple other partners may also be involved. The project duration is 24-48 months. The deadline for the full application is September 2, 2026, at 5:00 PM (by invitation only).
