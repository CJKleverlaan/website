# Overview of health cohorts and monitors with oral health data

One of the aims of the ORANGE Force project is to improve the findability and accessibility of existing data on oral health and general health for researchers. By doing so, the project seeks to stimulate collaboration and enable epidemiological research on oral health, general health, and shared risk factors in population groups in the Netherlands.

# What can you find on this webpage?
This webpage provides an overview of Dutch health cohorts and monitors in which oral health data are collected. The overview includes cohorts and monitors in which data have been collected after 2010. For each cohort or monitor, information is available on:
* the aims, population, study design and follow-up
* the data collected on health, behaviour, and other characteristics;
* the data collected on oral health;
* the data collection methods used (for example questionnaires, clinical examinations, biosamples);
* the procedure for requesting access to the data;
* additional information, such as references to the design paper and/or website.

# What do we mean by health cohorts and monitors?
By health cohorts and monitors, we refer to studies based on samples from the general population or specific population groups, in which data are collected at multiple time points. These include, for example, longitudinal health cohorts and national and municipal health and youth monitors.

# Additions and suggestions?
Do you know of other existing cohorts or monitors that include oral health data, or in which such data could potentially be added? If so, please feel free to contact researcher Denise Duijster (D.Duijster@acta.nl)
