title: "Measuring health in the mouth"

---

This line of research is the fundamental research component of ORANGEFORCE and focuses on innovative methods to detect early signs of abnormal health in the mouth. In the longer term, this may lead to new diagnostics. This line of research consists of two parts:

1. Saliva collection and oral detection

We investigated different techniques for saliva; An unstimulated saliva sample of 2 minutes or a mouthwash sample (20-30 seconds) appear to be reliable for (bio)medical research. In these samples, both specific biomarkers and protein profiles can be measured. Clinical pilot studies show a specific and unique ‘fingerprint’ for periodontitis compared to healthy controls. For Sjögren’s disease, the salivary ion concentrations of sodium and chloride appear to be a reliable biomarker. This also provides starting points for faster treatment for other systemic diseases.

The data from the Maastricht Study will start in January 2024 to analyse the correlations between periodontitis, diabetes and other morbidities with biomarkers in corresponding mouthwash samples. Questionnaire research shows that 80% of dental and medical patients are willing to participate in simple general health check-ups at the dental practice. There is a slight preference for providing saliva samples rather than blood droplets obtained with a finger prick.

2. Intra-oral detection

Acid reflux from the stomach, especially at night, is a major risk factor for tooth erosion. The project team has developed an intra-oral pH sensor to measure intra-oral acidity. In vitro tests have been carried out for reliability and stability (thermal stability; time effects (drift); viscosity effects). The next phase will be a pilot clinical study on the feasibility and early performance of the intra-oral pH sensor in volunteers.
