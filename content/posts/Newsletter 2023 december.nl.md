At the beginning of 2024, the ORANGEHealth team wishes you an inspiring and successful year. We would like to give you an update of everything that has been achieved by our researchers and partners in the first full year of our Kickstart project ORANGEFORCE.

The ORANGEFORCE project focuses specifically on oral care for older persons from a holistic approach. After all, an unhealthy mouth irrevocably leads to a reduction in overall health. Especially in the case of frail older people, in combination with other conditions and the use of medications, the focus on oral health can be weakened and lead to unnecessary reductions in quality of life.

ORANGEFORCE is committed to putting people first and connecting oral care with the entire care network so that the most appropriate care is provided. The fundamental scientific component within ORANGEFORCE is also concerned with unravelling the relationship between diseases in the mouth and those in the rest of the body. The sooner a disease can be detected, the greater the chance of successful treatment.

On behalf of the ORANGEHealth team, Willem Fokkema
