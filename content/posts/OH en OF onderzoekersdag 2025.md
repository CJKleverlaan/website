On 8 December 2025, ORANGEHealth and ORANGEForce once again organised their annual Research Day, this time at the Dentistry Department of Radboudumc in Nijmegen. More than forty researchers took part. During the plenary programme, brief updates were given on the progress made within the three lines of research. The focus then shifted to the future, with a concise explanation of the PPP programme and possible starting points—both within and outside it—for future research proposals. The researchers then split into three working groups to further shape new initiatives. The day ended with a convivial drinks reception. All in all, we can look back on a very successful day.
