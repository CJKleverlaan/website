In 2025, the ORANGEHealth-PPS program carried out the “Innovation Booster” call, drew up a progress report, and held an interview meeting with Health-Holland about it. Based on this, Health-Holland issued a positive recommendation for the start of the coming program year 2026, with the associated PPS grant of €1.35 million. To implement the program, the ORANGEHealth-PPS program will publish a new call text in mid-January entitled “Appropriate, Person-Centered, Effective & Efficient Care.” All associated application forms will, of course, also be made available on our website. We look forward to the new program year and further collaboration with great enthusiasm.  Finally, we wish everyone happy holidays and a healthy and inspiring New Year!
