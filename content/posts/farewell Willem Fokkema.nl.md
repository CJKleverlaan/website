On June 6, 2024, Willem Fokkema retired as Program Leader of ORANGEHealth to enjoy his well-deserved retirement. Willem has been of immense importance as a pioneer of the public-private consortium ORANGEHealth, and has always effectively, connectively, and enthusiastically carried out our mission to implement the preventive model of dental care in general healthcare. We want to thank Willem for his tireless efforts and wish him all the best for the future. Happy sailing!
