        The seven Dutch educational institutions for oral care and dentistry have joined forces in ORANGEHealth. In addition to education they conduct research and provide care. These seven partners are the initiators of a multi-year program in which they, together with public and private parties, are shaping the future of (oral) care and (oral) health, with special attention to prevention, the right care in the right place, interprofessional cooperation and attention to vulnerable groups. The consortium gives substance to the increasingly resounding call for more collaboration between oral health care and general health care.
