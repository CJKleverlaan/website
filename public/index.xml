      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-impact-of-saliva-collection-methods-on-measured-salivary-biomarker-levels&#34;&gt;The impact of saliva collection methods on measured salivary biomarker levels&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;H Al Habobe, EB Haverkort, K Nazmi, AP Van Splunter, RHH Pieters, FJ Bikker (&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2023.117628&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2023.117628&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Saliva diagnostics have become increasingly popular due to their non-invasive nature and patient-friendly collection process. Various collection methods are available, yet these are not always well standardized for either quantitative or qualitative analysis. In line, the objective of this study was to evaluate if measured levels of various biomarkers in the saliva of healthy individuals were affected by three distinct saliva collection methods: 1) unstimulated saliva, 2) chew stimulated saliva, and 3) oral rinse. Saliva samples from 30 healthy individuals were obtained by the three collection methods. Then, the levels of various salivary biomarkers such as proteins and ions were determined. It was found that levels of various biomarkers obtained from unstimulated saliva were comparable to those in chew stimulated saliva. The levels of potassium, sodium, and amylase activity differed significantly among the three collection methods. Levels of all biomarkers measured using the oral rinse method significantly differed from those obtained from unstimulated and chew-stimulated saliva. In conclusion, both unstimulated and chew-stimulated saliva provided comparable levels for a diverse group of biomarkers. However, the results obtained from the oral rinse method significantly differed from those of unstimulated and chew-stimulated saliva, due to the diluted nature of the saliva extract&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On December 9th, the annual ORANGEHealth Researchers’ Day took place, which attracted great interest from consortium members representing all seven knowledge institutes. After a brief update on the current state of affairs within the ORANGEHealth consortium by the new program leaders Frank Walboomers and Katarina Jerkovic, the remainder of the program was expertly moderated by the chair of the day, Egija Zaura.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The theme of the day was “matchmaking”. Knowledge institutions were given the opportunity to present new research ideas, focusing on the rationale (problem articulation), potential research questions/objectives, research methodology and design, possible partners, and funding opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Friday, June 14, 2024, the second partner day of the ORANGEForce project took place. The day coincided with the Dutch Dental Science Days of all dental care training programs in the Netherlands and was well attended. In addition to the researchers, there were representatives from various partners such as Philips, KIMO, the professional associations KNMT and NVM, the Dutch Association for Gerodontology, NIVEL, Vitadent, the new partner Omnios, the elderly delegation from NUZO, and other dental care professionals. RIVM, VWS, and Health Holland also followed the latest developments of ORANGEForce with great interest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of 2024, the ORANGEHealth team wishes you an inspiring and successful year. We would like to give you an update of everything that has been achieved by our researchers and partners in the first full year of our Kickstart project ORANGEFORCE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ORANGEFORCE project focuses specifically on oral care for older persons from a holistic approach. After all, an unhealthy mouth irrevocably leads to a reduction in overall health. Especially in the case of frail older people, in combination with other conditions and the use of medications, the focus on oral health can be weakened and lead to unnecessary reductions in quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Innovative approach for oral care for older persons</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This research line is concerned with the research into oral care for older persons in oral care practice, vulnerable elderly people who need oral care at home and the development of the practice guideline for interprofessional cooperation on oral care for elderly people living at home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our research has shown that the awareness and implementation of the guidelines and the KNMT Practice Guide for oral care for older persons still needs to be greatly improved in oral care practices. In the coming months, we will make a plan on how we are going to do that. All ideas are welcome.The UMCG research into oral health among elderly people with cognitive challenges who visit a memory clinic is going well. There are already many participants and the results are promising. The first findings from this study will be published during the consortium meeting in June 2024. ACTA’s study on oral care for older persons in the home setting will start soon. Among other things, (cost) effectiveness, impact on quality of life and the reasons why older people do or cannot receive oral care at home will be examined. Researchers from Amsterdam, Groningen, Nijmegen and Utrecht are developing a practice guideline for interprofessional oral care for vulnerable older people living at home. With input from literature research, semi-structured interviews with healthcare providers and focus groups with general practitioners (and POH), pharmacists, oral care providers, home care and GGD employees, a draft of this guideline for interprofessional oral care has been drawn up. Through various cycles of implementation, testing and adaptation in practice, the concept will be adjusted and further developed into an effective guideline for vulnerable older people living at home. After that, the guideline will be used to support interprofessional collaboration. This design research will take place in 5 regions in the Netherlands. The contacts with the caregivers, but also with older persons are already promising!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Measuring health in the mouth</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This line of research is the fundamental research component of ORANGEFORCE and focuses on innovative methods to detect early signs of abnormal health in the mouth. In the longer term, this may lead to new diagnostics. This line of research consists of two parts:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Saliva collection and oral detection&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We investigated different techniques for saliva; An unstimulated saliva sample of 2 minutes or a mouthwash sample (20-30 seconds) appear to be reliable for (bio)medical research. In these samples, both specific biomarkers and protein profiles can be measured. Clinical pilot studies show a specific and unique ‘fingerprint’ for periodontitis compared to healthy controls. For Sjögren’s disease, the salivary ion concentrations of sodium and chloride appear to be a reliable biomarker. This also provides starting points for faster treatment for other systemic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ORANGEFORCE is the Kickstart project of the ORANGEHealth consortium that has been running for three years now. ORANGEFORCE (ORal ANd GEneral For OldeR People’s CarE) aims to ensure that elderly individuals are well-connected to the (oral) care system and remain so. We achieve this by developing guidelines that are not only useful in dental and oral care practices but also in professional care settings (care institutions, general practitioners). Besides initiating physical collaboration and consultation between oral care professionals and primary care, efforts are being made to make (patient) information accessible, allowing data to be used for research purposes. Finally, research on saliva and databases increasingly reveals the relationship between overall health and oral health, and work is being done on supportive diagnostic tools for oral care professionals and primary care to recognize underlying diseases as early as possible through the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This line of research focuses on large-scale data on oral health. Ultimately, the goal is to build an infrastructure that supports a learning care system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part 1 of the line deals with cohorts. This is where data is collected about the health of participants. Sometimes oral health is already a part of that data, or it can be added. The data is usually collected via questionnaires, i.e. reported by the participant himself. In the picture of the Netherlands you can see the cohorts that have already joined. We are currently looking at how the oral health data of these cohorts can be combined.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
