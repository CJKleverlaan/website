    <p>On December 9th, the annual ORANGEHealth Researchers’ Day took place, which attracted great interest from consortium members representing all seven knowledge institutes. After a brief update on the current state of affairs within the ORANGEHealth consortium by the new program leaders Frank Walboomers and Katarina Jerkovic, the remainder of the program was expertly moderated by the chair of the day, Egija Zaura.</p>
<p>The theme of the day was “matchmaking”. Knowledge institutions were given the opportunity to present new research ideas, focusing on the rationale (problem articulation), potential research questions/objectives, research methodology and design, possible partners, and funding opportunities.</p>
<p>In four sessions, each featuring five pitches, demand-driven research ideas aligned with the mission of ORANGEHealth were presented. Following each pitch session, peer discussions took place, during which participants engaged in conversations to identify new partners and discuss the most suitable funding strategies. The themes ranged from the use of AI tools for behavioral change, biomarkers for people with Sjögren’s Disease, and biomarkers in saliva, to building community networks, implementing clinical guidelines, and addressing health literacy and shared decision-making in oral healthcare.
An important outcome of the day was that consortium members will prepare an EU MSCA application in 2025. Additionally, other initiatives were discussed for grant applications to ZonMw and SIA Regieorgaan. The high level of interest in pitching resulted in not all submitted initiatives being addressed
The Researchers’ Day will continue in June 2025 during the Dutch Dental Science Days in Lunteren, the annual event where both current and potential new public and private partners are invited. Companies, professional organizations, scientific associations,and patients will come together there in support of the ORANGEHealth mission. This offers an excellent opportunity to further develop ongoing initiatives and jointly create new ideas with the involved partners.</p>
