      <title>Positive recommendation for ORANGEHealth-PPS 2026</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2025, the ORANGEHealth-PPS program carried out the “Innovation Booster” call, drew up a progress report, and held an interview meeting with Health-Holland about it. Based on this, Health-Holland issued a positive recommendation for the start of the coming program year 2026, with the associated PPS grant of €1.35 million. To implement the program, the ORANGEHealth-PPS program will publish a new call text in mid-January entitled “Appropriate, Person-Centered, Effective &amp;amp; Efficient Care.” All associated application forms will, of course, also be made available on our website. We look forward to the new program year and further collaboration with great enthusiasm.  Finally, we wish everyone happy holidays and a healthy and inspiring New Year!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On 8 December 2025, ORANGEHealth and ORANGEForce once again organised their annual Research Day, this time at the Dentistry Department of Radboudumc in Nijmegen. More than forty researchers took part. During the plenary programme, brief updates were given on the progress made within the three lines of research. The focus then shifted to the future, with a concise explanation of the PPP programme and possible starting points—both within and outside it—for future research proposals. The researchers then split into three working groups to further shape new initiatives. The day ended with a convivial drinks reception. All in all, we can look back on a very successful day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On December 9th, the annual ORANGEHealth Researchers’ Day took place, which attracted great interest from consortium members representing all seven knowledge institutes. After a brief update on the current state of affairs within the ORANGEHealth consortium by the new program leaders Frank Walboomers and Katarina Jerkovic, the remainder of the program was expertly moderated by the chair of the day, Egija Zaura.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The theme of the day was “matchmaking”. Knowledge institutions were given the opportunity to present new research ideas, focusing on the rationale (problem articulation), potential research questions/objectives, research methodology and design, possible partners, and funding opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of 2024, the ORANGEHealth team wishes you an inspiring and successful year. We would like to give you an update of everything that has been achieved by our researchers and partners in the first full year of our Kickstart project ORANGEFORCE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ORANGEFORCE project focuses specifically on oral care for older persons from a holistic approach. After all, an unhealthy mouth irrevocably leads to a reduction in overall health. Especially in the case of frail older people, in combination with other conditions and the use of medications, the focus on oral health can be weakened and lead to unnecessary reductions in quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
