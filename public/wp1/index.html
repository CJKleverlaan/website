ORANGEFORCE (ORal ANd GEneral For OldeR People’s CarE) aims to ensure that elderly individuals are well-connected to the (oral) care system and remain so. We achieve this by developing guidelines that are not only useful in dental and oral care practices but also in professional care settings (care institutions, general practitioners). Besides initiating physical collaboration and consultation between oral care professionals and primary care, efforts are being made to make (patient) information accessible, allowing data to be used for research purposes. Finally, research on saliva and databases increasingly reveals the relationship between overall health and oral health, and work is being done on supportive diagnostic tools for oral care professionals and primary care to recognize underlying diseases as early as possible through the mouth.">

<p>This project consists of three research lines, summarized below.</p>
<p>Research Line 1: ‘Innovative (oral) healthcare approaches for older people’</p>
<p>Research Line 2: ‘Unlocking and Linking oral health data’</p>
<p>Research line 3: ‘Sensing the oral cavity’ (“extra- and intra-oral sensing”)</p>
